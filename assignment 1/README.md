About the program:
    The program should fully work as intended. To run the program with a file use "./main < filename". To run with input use ./main and give the input, to end the program press enter, an error will still be given but this can be ignored. The only problem our program might have is that our tokenarray has a maximum size of 5000 so if an expression is larger than 5000 tokens the program will most likely fail. This value can easily be changed in the token.h file. 

Memory leaks:
    When testing we did not encounter any memory leaks except for still reachable leaks. These still reachable leaks are because we end the program with exit(0) and can be avoided by replacing exit(0) with return 0.

How the program works:
    The program reads from standard input using getline() and can have multiple expression as input because we use a while loop.
    The first step in the program is creating a token array from the input expression. This is done by creating a token for each charachter in the input string, since variables are longer and need to satisfy certain condition we use a while loop and a large if statment. We also check if the amount of open and closing brackets is equal when creating the token array.

    After creating the token array we add applications to the array by checking where they need to be places. This function is quite complicated but is based on the amount of variables that are not part of a lambda abstraction.
    
    After this we pars the token array using a peek and consume function and a class counter j to remember the position in the token array. The array is parsed using the following LL grammar:
        <expr> = <lexpr><expr'>
        <expr'> = <lexpr><expr'> | empty
        <lexpr> = <pexpr> | Î» <var> <lexpr>
        <pexpr> = <var> | (<expr>)
    The parser reports an error and exits the program with status 1 if the expression does not satisfy the LL grammar.

    After parsing the expression we want to output the expression unambiguous with the least amount of whitespace and parentheses.
    To create the output in an easy manner we build a tree. To build this tree we first create a postifx token array by using a algorithm to convert infix to prefix that uses a stack.
    We then create the output by walking through the tree inorder.
    
    hier nog uitleg hoe printinfix werkt en onze ouput format.
    
    After this we call the destructor for the tree to avoid memory leaks.
